Usage:
------

Field:
~~~~~~
The quickest way to add rich text capabilities to your models is to use the included ``RichTextField`` model field type. A CKEditor widget is rendered as the form field but in all other regards the field behaves as the standard Django ``TextField``. For example::

    from django.db import models
    from ckeditor.fields import RichTextField

    class Post(models.Model):
        content = RichTextField()


Widget:
~~~~~~~
Alernatively you can use the included ``CKEditorWidget`` as the widget for a formfield. For example::

    from django import forms
    from django.contrib import admin
    from ckeditor.widgets import CKEditorWidget

    from post.models import Post

    class PostAdminForm(forms.ModelForm):
        content = forms.CharField(widget=CKEditorWidget())
        class Meta:
            model = Post

    class PostAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
        form = PostAdminForm
    
    admin.site.register(Post, PostAdmin)
